# Fingerprints

Every site you build with **scroll-craft** gets one row here, appended after it
ships. The registry exists so your next build can prove it is a different page
rather than a re-skin of one you already made.

This file is **yours**. It starts empty on purpose: the gate is about not
repeating *yourself*, so it has nothing to say until you have built something.

The rules and the gate live in the skill's
`references/uniqueness.md`. Short version:

**A new build must differ from EVERY row below on at least 4 of the 6
dimensions.** Four against each row individually, not four on average across the
table. If a planned build fails, change the plan. Never edit a row to make room
for it.

The six dimensions are: **grammar**, **nav treatment**, **hero device**,
**act-sequence shape**, **close pattern**, **signature move**.

Dimension 6 is free, because a signature move is unique by definition. So the
gate really asks for three more out of the remaining five, and a build that
changes only grammar and world will fail it.

## The registry

| Build | Grammar | Nav treatment | Hero device | Act-sequence shape | Close pattern | Signature move | World | Port |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| accord-vi-immersive | Chaptered editorial | Folio (chapter number + title, fixed bottom-right, no bar) | Title page: type-only flow+in hero, no media above the fold | 6 acts, flow > pin(4.0) > pan(4.4) > flow > flow > pin(1.2), ~12.6vh | Colophon: pinned, one-value hold, CTA set as underlined running-text links (not a button), links out to the site's own registration/sponsor pages | Resonance mark (event's 6-arc identity symbol) drawn arc-by-arc via `stroke-dashoffset` driven by whole-page scroll fraction, fixed and persistent for the entire page, fully resonant only at the close | Photographic (real stock concert photography), navy/brass maximalist palette | 4501 |

## What is taken

Add a bullet here whenever a build claims something a later build should avoid
reusing: a grammar, a nav treatment, a close pattern, a signature move, an
act-count-and-length band. The shared columns are what the next build inherits
as a constraint, so writing them down is the whole point.

- **Chaptered editorial** grammar is taken.
- **Folio nav** (chapter number + title, fixed corner, no bar) is taken.
- **Colophon close with running-text links** (no button island) is taken.
- The **scroll-driven identity-mark-as-progress-indicator** signature move is
  taken — a future build needs a genuinely different mechanic, not just a
  different mark or a different property being drawn.
- Act-count-and-length band **6 acts at ~12.6vh** is taken.
- A **click-to-expand inline roster** (button reveals a grouped list on the
  same section, no navigation away) is taken as this build's way of handling
  a long, low-priority list without a second page or a repeated card grid.

## Appending a row

After shipping, add one line to the table and one bullet to **What is taken** if
the build claimed something new. Fill every column. Say what the build shares
with existing rows.

Rows are append-only. A build that has been superseded stays in the table,
because the space it occupies is still occupied.

## Worked example

The skill's author kept a registry of twelve builds across eight page grammars.
If you want to see what a filled-in table looks like, and which shapes tend to
collide, read `EXAMPLES.md` in the scroll-craft repository. Treat it as
illustration only: those rows are somebody else's builds and they do **not**
constrain yours.
